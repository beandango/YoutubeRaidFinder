# Youtube Raid Finder

### A tool to help youtube streamers find other streamers on Youtube to redirect/raid into!

The webapp uses python + flask to pull youtube livestream data from Google's Youtube Data API v3 
to help you easily see current livestreams, sorted by subscriber or viewer count, with language detection and filtering based on the titles of the streams using Facebook's fasttext language detection model. 

## See the releases tab for the latest build :)
